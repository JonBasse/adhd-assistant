## Can't Start Decision Tree

When stuck, diagnose the block:

### Is it too big?
**Signs:** Feeling overwhelmed, don't know where to begin
**Fix:** Break it down until the first step takes < 5 minutes
**Example:** "Write report" → "Open document and write one sentence"

### Is it too boring?
**Signs:** Task feels tedious, mind wanders immediately
**Fix:** Add stimulation
- Background music or podcast
- Timer challenge ("Can I finish before the song ends?")
- Pair with something enjoyable (nice drink, comfortable spot)
- Promise yourself a reward after

### Is it too unclear?
**Signs:** Vague sense of what to do, paralysis from ambiguity
**Fix:** Define the next physical action
- Bad: "Work on project"
- Good: "Open email from Sarah and reply to her question"

### Is it too scary?
**Signs:** Anxiety, avoidance, catastrophizing
**Fix:** Reality-check the fear
- What's the actual worst case?
- Is it survivable? (Usually yes)
- What would you tell a friend?
- Can you do the tiniest piece just to start?

### Is it the wrong time?
**Signs:** Fighting your energy, forcing focus
**Fix:** Match task to energy
- Save hard tasks for peak hours
- Do admin/shallow work when tired
- Know your patterns (morning person? night owl?)

### Is it the wrong environment?
**Signs:** Constant distractions, can't settle
**Fix:** Change something
- Different room or location
- Noise-canceling headphones
- Phone in another room
- Website blocker on
- Work alongside someone (body doubling)

### Do you need support?
**Signs:** Isolation makes it worse, accountability helps
**Fix:** Get external structure
- Body doubling (virtual or in-person)
- Tell someone your plan
- Set a check-in time
- Work in public (café, library)

## Recovery After Derailment

When you've fallen off track (bad day, bad week, or longer):

### Step 1: No guilt trip
"You're here now. That's what matters."

This is not a character flaw. ADHD makes consistency harder. Getting back on track IS the skill.

### Step 2: Tiny restart
- Do NOT overhaul your entire system
- Pick ONE small thing to do today
- Success = doing that one thing

### Step 3: Lower the bar temporarily
- 50% of normal is a win while rebuilding
- Momentum matters more than volume
- Build back up gradually over days

### Step 4: Identify the trigger
What knocked you off?
- Illness or low energy?
- Stressful event?
- Travel or disruption?
- System was too complicated?
- Life just happened?

Knowing the cause helps prevent repeat.

### Step 5: Adjust, don't abandon
- Tweak the system that failed
- Don't throw out everything
- What's the minimum viable version?

### Fresh start opportunities
Use natural resets to rebuild momentum:
- New week (Monday)
- New month
- After a vacation
- After illness recovery
- Seasonal changes

## Common Pitfalls

### The Planning Trap
**Problem:** Spending all energy planning, none executing
**Fix:** Limit planning to 10 minutes. Imperfect action beats perfect plans.

### The All-or-Nothing Trap
**Problem:** "I missed morning routine so the day is ruined"
**Fix:** Any time is a valid starting point. Partial days count.

### The Productivity Guilt Trap
**Problem:** Rest feels like failure
**Fix:** Rest is productive. Burnout is not. Schedule rest intentionally.

### The New System Trap
**Problem:** Constantly switching tools/methods hoping for magic fix
**Fix:** Stick with "good enough" for 2+ weeks before evaluating.

### The Comparison Trap
**Problem:** Measuring yourself against neurotypical standards
**Fix:** Compare to your past self, not others. ADHD is a different operating system.

### The Hyperfocus Trap
**Problem:** Productive on wrong thing, ignore priorities
**Fix:** Check priorities BEFORE starting. Set alarms for hard stops.

## Emergency Protocols

### "I have a deadline in 2 hours and haven't started"

1. **Stop panicking** (30 seconds breathing)
2. **What's the minimum viable output?** Not perfect, just acceptable
3. **First 5-minute action:** Open the thing, write one sentence/line
4. **Remove all distractions:** Phone away, close other tabs
5. **Set 25-minute timer:** Just get through one sprint
6. **Ship it:** Done is better than perfect

### "I completely forgot something important"

1. **Damage assessment:** Is it fixable? Usually yes.
2. **Immediate action:** What can you do RIGHT NOW?
3. **Communicate:** If others affected, brief honest message
4. **Prevent recurrence:** Add reminder system for next time
5. **Self-compassion:** Memory issues are neurological, not moral

### "I'm spiraling and can't function"

1. **Physical first:** Stand up, cold water on face, step outside
2. **Name it:** "I'm overwhelmed" or "I'm in RSD" or "I'm anxious"
3. **Smallest possible action:** One tiny thing to feel agency
4. **Get support:** Text someone, body double, talk it out
5. **Permission to pause:** Sometimes stopping IS the right choice

### "Everything feels equally urgent"

1. **Brain dump:** Get it all out of your head onto paper
2. **Hard deadlines:** What has an actual immovable deadline?
3. **Consequences:** What causes real problems if not done?
4. **Smallest first:** Pick the quickest one to build momentum
5. **Accept imperfection:** You can't do everything. That's okay.
