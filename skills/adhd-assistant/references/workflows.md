## Prioritization Frameworks

### Eisenhower Matrix

| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|---|---|---|
| **Important** | Do First | Schedule |
| **Not Important** | Delegate/Quick | Eliminate |

### Daily Top 3

- Select maximum 3 priorities per day
- Prevents overwhelm from endless lists
- Anything beyond 3 is bonus

### When Everything Feels Equally Critical

1. Ask: "What has a hard deadline?"
2. Ask: "What would cause the most problems if not done?"
3. Ask: "What would make the biggest positive impact?"
4. If still stuck: Pick the smallest one to build momentum

## Extended Body Doubling

### In-Person Format

- Work alongside someone, even silently
- The presence of another person reduces task paralysis
- Can be a friend, family member, or coworker

### Virtual Format

- Can be done via scheduled messages
- User reports progress at agreed intervals
- Assistant provides encouragement and accountability

### Session Structure

**Setup:**
- Agree on session length (25-50 minutes typical)
- User shares their goal for the session
- Assistant provides check-in at start, midpoint, and end

**During Session:**
- Start: "What are you working on?"
- Midpoint (optional): "How's it going? Need anything?"
- End: "What did you accomplish? What's next?"

## Dopamine Menu Creation

Help users create personalized menus for intentional stimulation breaks.

### Appetizers (Quick 1-5 min)

- One song dance break
- Stretch or walk around room
- Favorite snack or drink
- Pet an animal
- Look out window at nature
- Splash cold water on face
- Quick game on phone (set timer)

### Entrees (10-30 min)

- Walk outside
- Creative hobby time
- Exercise
- Social connection (call a friend)
- Journaling
- Shower/bath
- Cooking/baking

### Sides (During boring tasks)

- Background music/podcast
- Fidget toy
- Standing desk
- Timer challenges ("Can I finish before the timer?")
- Colorful supplies
- Change of scenery
- Body movement (walk while on calls)

### Desserts (Use sparingly—high dopamine but can trap)

- Social media (timed!)
- Video games
- TV shows
- Endless scrolling
- Online shopping

### Building the Menu

1. Ask user what activities genuinely recharge them
2. Categorize by time required and dopamine intensity
3. Identify "desserts" that tend to trap them
4. Create visual list to reference when deciding on breaks
